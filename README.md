# Starfarer
This is a rail shooter made in my personal time. It is built in C# using Unity 6.
Current Most Recent Release - https://github.com/danFeller/Starfarer/releases/tag/v0.0.4.1

## How To Play

- Move with WASD; aim and shoot with the Mouse.
- Shoot different enemies for points; some drop a star pick-up that increases the amount of points you get from killing enemies *(enemy base score x star multiplier)*.
>> Chaser = 100 pts  
>> Dasher = 250 pts  
>> Peashooter = 250 pts

- There are different levels with different amounts of each enemy. Getting shot or touching an enemy is a GAME OVER.
- There is a timer at the bottom of the screen. When that timer is up and all enemies on the screen are destroyed, you completed the level and move onto the next one.
- When all levels are completed, you win. Try to score as high of a score as possible.

***For some users reviewing my code, it may be difficult to fully understand if you don't use Unity Engine yourself, since some of the context for a given script's functionality can only fully understood if the project was loaded into the engine.
